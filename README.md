- **DevOps & Infrastructure Veteran** with 25+ years shaping reliable, scalable systems (virtual machines, infra tooling, deep stack experience).
- **OSS Advocate** focused on open collaboration, contributor onboarding, and scalable QA/QC workflows.
- **Accessibility Evangelist** committed to genuinely usable, inclusive tech - because advanced tech may be indistinguishable from magic, but real magic includes *everyone*.
- Currently contributing to projects exploring **MPC/TSS** wallet infrastructure and quantum-aware key management models.

### Core Beliefs:
- Tech should empower every user - not just the fortunate or technical.
- Real security and future-proofing (e.g., quantum computing resilience) are design essentials, not afterthoughts.
- Collaboration through open-source is how we build sustainable, durable solutions.

If you're building open, accessible infrastructure that still matters a decade from now - I'll test it, document it, and chase the edge cases. Let's build together.
