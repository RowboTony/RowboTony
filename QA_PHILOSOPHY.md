# My QA Philosophy – by RowboTony

## Why I care

I do QA because I care about the user - the real human being on the other side of the screen. The one trying to recover their vault at 2AM. The one onboarding with doubt in their gut. The one who’s placing trust in this software to hold their money, identity, or future.

If we lose their trust, we lose everything.

## What I believe

- QA is not about catching bugs. It's about protecting users.
- Polish isn’t perfectionism. It's a signal of care. It says: “We thought this through. We respect your time."
- Inconsistency is a user tax. It causes friction, confusion, and subtle mistrust - especially in critical flows like onboarding, backup, and recovery.
- Being the person who notices flaws isn't always fun. But it’s necessary. Ignoring them costs more later - in support tickets, user churn, and brand damage.
- I don’t bring problems to criticize. I bring them to make us better.

## What you can expect from me

- I will speak up early and often - especially when I see issues others might overlook.
- I will always advocate for the end user - not my ego, not the roadmap, not the clock.
- I will bring detail and documentation, not just vague complaints.
- I will keep it collaborative and constructive. I’m not here to nitpick. I’m here to build.
- If I’m quiet, assume I’m testing or observing - not disengaged.

## What I ask from you

- Don’t take QA feedback personally. I’m not judging your work - I’m strengthening it.
- Treat polish and clarity as part of the product - not afterthoughts.
- Let’s align early when possible. It’s cheaper than rework later.
- Know that if I’m flagging something, it’s because I believe the user deserves better.

## Final word

You don’t need to agree with every note I give. But if you know I’m fighting for the user - and for the integrity of what we ship - then we’re already on the same side.

Let’s build with integrity.
